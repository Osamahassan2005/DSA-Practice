# DSA-Practice
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice work, including lab sessions, exercises, and implementations in Python.
The code covers fundamental concepts such as:

Arrays and Linked Lists

Stacks and Queues

Searching and Sorting algorithms

Recursive approaches

Other lab-based problem solving


The repo is mainly for learning and revision purposes, showcasing step-by-step implementations according to given algorithms from lab sessions.
